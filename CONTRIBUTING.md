# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.

As far as I can tell there a few possible types of welcome contributions
1. More Data Artifacts
2. More Sample Code
3. Gallery Images

## üî¢ More Data Artifacts
Within the `data/` folder, there is currently only 1 child directory: `year_2018__cell_500k`.
This is indicative of the fact that Max Roser's [source article](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram) is based on 2018 data, and uses the convention of "one square = 500,000 people".  I figured either of those variables could be changed, and thus new datasets can be born.

If you've got a dataset that uses a different year, or different human-to-cell ratio üì£ PLEASE CONTRIBUTE IT.

I will require you to match the format of existing data artifacts. There is a small set of code in `src/` that assists in creating some of these data artifacts:
```
                                                                /squares_and_triangles
                                                                |--- cells.csv
                                                                |--- borders.csv
                                                                |--- countries.svg
                                                                |--- geo.json
                                                                |--- projected_geo.json
                                                                |--- topo.json
/squares_and_triangles/cells.csv  -->  computeBoundaries.py -->
                                                                /squares
                                                                |--- cells.csv
                                                                |--- borders.csv
                                                                |--- countries.svg
                                                                |--- geo.json
                                                                |--- projected_geo.json
                                                                |--- topo.json
```

This architecture is meant to assist in potential expansion of the repository to house future cartogram designs (maybe different years, or different persons-per-cell). All that a contributor would need to manually generate is a `/squares_and_triangles/cells.csv` file. The rest can be automatically generated by `computeBoundaries.py`.


## üë©‚Äçüíª More Sample Code
Nothing formal for now. Just open a PR and we'll figure something out. Maybe we'll make a a directory of sample code or something.

## üñº Gallery Images
Nothing formal for now. Just tweet at me or open a PR - we'll figure something out. Maybe we'll make a `GALLERY.md` or something.
